##Write a program to sum a series of numbers entered by the user. The program should first
#prompt the user for how many numbers are to be summed. The program should then prompt
#the user for each of the numbers in turn and print out a total sum after all the numbers have
#been entered.

def main():
    n = input("how many numbers should be summed?")
    values = []
    for i in range (x):
            values.append(input("enter a value"))
    Sum = sum(values)
    print(sum)
main()
