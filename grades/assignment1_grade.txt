Comments:
	-P2: Should ask the user only once and print result 5 times.
	-P4: Should prompt user for amount of numbers.
	-P5: fibonnaci sequence is not called and therefore doesn't run
		-It asks user for number at every recursive call (user is unaware of what's happening)
	-P6: Change function doesn't cover some edge cases (e.g. 0.009999999 should return 1 coin)
	-Your README can be just text, no need for quotes around each line. It should also be clearer, and well formatted for users to reference easily (headings, sections, etc.).
	-MAKE SURE TO DOCUMENT ALL OF YOUR CODE!
